# @muffin-tin/components (1.0.0-alpha)

Utilities for building [React](https://react.dev) design component libraries with [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/)

_This package is still in alpha, do not use in production_

---

## Installation

```js
npm install @muffin-tin/components
```

---

## Prerequisites

Latest `React (18.2)`. You are expected to pass a `Sprinkles`-function from `vanilla-extract` to the component to enable its style props, but technically the package does not depend on `vanilla-extract` â€“ and you _could_ pass a function from a wholly different source if its signature is similar enough (check the types to learn more).

---

## Contents

Contains the following helpers to kick-start building component libraries.

- `createBaseComponent`: A generator function for a fundamental _Box_ Component, must be supplied with a [Sprinkles](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/packages/sprinkles/)-Function and optionally a class for default styling. Customize its types by passing which HTML attributes you don't not want consumers to use.

- `createComponent`: Similar generator function but you can pass a base-component to extend (must be forwarding its Ref). Consume e.g. your `Box` and compose higher-order components for your library.

- `composeClassName`: Resilient utility to compose `className` attributes. Used internally by the component creation functions.

- `extractAtomsFromProps`: Utility that separates component props into `Sprinkles` and non-`Sprinkles` based ones. Used internally by the component creation functions.

Check the TypeScript types for more information.
